Olegbot is a discord bot written in py which I hope to turn into a useful tool for language study.

If you wish to use olegbot, contact me (oleg#1357) via disc.

In olegbotnobottoken.py read the code for /helpme function for an outline of current functions. 

Currently planned commands and functions:

   - /createkanjibook
    {create user's dict. to store kanji characters}
    
   - /drawkanjifrom(nX, kanjibook)
    {using html.Canvas, embed canvas in chat in which user can attempt to draw a kanji character from random in N(5,4,3,2,1) , or kanjibook}
    
   - /checkstrokeorder
    {allows user to search stroke order for specified kanji or randomkanji in: (dict.)}
    
if you have any suggestions for useful commands, kindly contact me and let me know.
